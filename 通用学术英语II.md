## What is a summary? How is a summary different from a quotation?

A summary is a condensed version of the original text that highlights the main or key ideas in one’s own words. 

Compared with a quotation, a summary forces us to comprehend as we read. A summary can lead to an evaluation of the original text or our own viewpoint on a certain issue.


## When summarising a source in an academic context, what conventions should we follow?

The primary purpose of summary is to help understand and retain information as we collect sources of reading. In addition, a summary can be used to inform our readers, substantiate our claims, and refer to previous studies. 

When summarising, include only the main points. A summary should be faithful to the original text and not twist the original meaning. A summary should not include personal opinions or responses.


## What are the criteria of evaluating a summary?

There are four standards for evaluating a summary. 

1) Completeness: including only the major points; giving a reference to the source text. 
2) Conciseness: being brief and condensed; removing unnecessary details such as illustrations, descriptions, or explanations. 
3) Accuracy: providing a clear picture of the source text; excluding any misinterpretation. 
4) Objectivity: including only the original viewpoints; excluding subjective evaluation or judgement of the writer.


## What are the five steps of writing a summary?

1. Introduce the title, author(s), and topic of the source text. 
2. Summarise the main points of the source text; use reporting verbs. 
3. See if the source text can be divided into sections. If so, summarise each section; if not, write a one-sentence summary for each paragraph. Use connectives where possible. 
4. Elaborate the points of particular interest or importance. 
5. Cite the source in a proper manner.


## What steps are involved when we refer to others work in our own writing?

1. Identify the point of reference. decide which part of the research article is most relevant to our own interest/argument. Underline/highlight the most important sentences. 
2. Paraphrase the referenced point. Present the important points accurately in our own words. Try not to quote directly the original sentences. 
3. Write the summary. Begin with an introductory sentence that states the articles title and author. Add other necessary information to relate the points to our own writing.
4. Revise for accuracy. Cheque our writing to see if it is faithful to the original text. Remove grammatical and mechanic errors.

## What is a synthesis? What are the components of a synthesis?

Synthesis is the act of combining separate things into a coherent whole. It involves analysis related to classification and division, comparison and contrast. It makes use of the ideas of other people, combining sources into one's own words to understand or establish context. There are two components: restatement and evaluation of sources.


## When synthesising different sources, how can we identify limitations of the studies?

There are three ways. 

1) Examine the design or methodology of the study to see if the experiment data is sufficient or if there are unexpected changes during the experiment. 
2) Examine the limitations sections of the paper to see what the authors have pointed out about their limitations. 
3) Keep an eye on how other studies reveal the limitations of a study.


## What is the typical order of logic in a synthesis?

Generally speaking, there are five steps in a synthesis.

1) Defining the issue under discussion. 
2) Narrowing down the issue to the current study. 
3) Posing problems in earlier studies. 
4) Proposing solutions. 
5) Offering suggestions.


## Seminal works are those of central importance to a research topic. What kind of studies can be regarded as seminal works? How can they be used?

Studies that report a major breakthrough, a nice sight or a novel thinking that stimulates later learning. The seminal works are a good place to begin research and lead to other studies. The works most relevant to the present study are usually stated last, before the authors’ own hypothesis is proposed, functioning as the steppingstone towards the next step further study.


## When reading literature, what can we do to find a niche for our own study about a research topic?

1. Infer the topic and discussion: think about the general topic and the specific issue. 
2. Be familiar with the related seminal works in the field: identify the relevant research, classify them into several groups. 
3. Clarify relations among studies: think about the relationships among previous studies, and the relationship between previous studies and your own study. 
4. Identify limitations of existing studies and your own study: find the niche.


## What steps can we follow to write a concession-rebuttal paragraph?

1. Recognise the opposing viewpoints. 
2. Acknowledge the value of opposing viewpoints: think about the premise and evidence. 
3. Rebut the opposing viewpoints: point out weaknesses in the premise, evidence or the opposing point of view. 
4. Support your rebuttal: use examples, facts, arguments to support the claim in your rebuttal.


## What approaches can we follow when conducting a literature review?

There are four approaches for literature reviews: 
1) chronological approach (identify the historical development and significant shift overtime)
2) thematic approach (put the literature into groups of themes)
3) methodological approach (identify the main methodologies)
4) combination approach (combine the approaches)


## What steps can we follow to search and read literature for literature review?

1. Search and collect relevant literature by using library sources and search engines. 
2. Read the collected sources to understand their major arguments and to rank them according to relevance to your own study.
3. Summarise the sources and take notes. 
4. Sort through the summaries and select the sources to be covered in your review.


## What steps can we follow to draft a literature review?

1) Design a thesis statement. 2) Organise the relevant sources by chronological, thematic, methodological, or combination structure. 
3) Write an introduction to show the scope, context, importance, and structure of your review. 
4) Conclude your review by summarising main findings pointing out values and implications. 
5) Use the proper citation by choosing from paraphrasing, quoting, summarising, and synthesising.


## What is the difference between a summary and a synthesis?

A summary is a recap or restatement of the important information of the source. The ideas, information and arguments of each source are stated in a concise manner. 

A synthesis critically analyzes and evaluates the information, including a critical analysis of the relationship between different sources, relate the sources to the author’s own research.


## What is a report?

A report is a logical and well-structured piece of writing that describes and analyses a particular subject or problem, communicates information collected from research or the analysis of data. 


## What are the differences between a report and an essay?

1) A report is fact-based and aim to convey information, while an essay is idea-based and is written to discuss different opinions and arguments. 
2) A report is broken into sections and subsections, while an essay usually flow as a continuous text. 
3) A report often includes graphics which rarely appears in an essay. 
4) A report may make predictions or recommendations while an essay doesn’t. 


## What sections does a report normally have?

1) A title page
2) An abstract
3) An introduction
4) Methods
5) Results
6) Discussion
7) Conclusion
8) Recommendations
9) References
